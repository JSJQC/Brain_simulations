# Brain_simulations
An early attempt at a neuron-type simulation based on the Game of Life.
To implement:
  - A control layer to implement control lines
  - Reading outputs
  - Some form of training; either back-propagation, or evolutionary
  - A reaction to stimulus; or some other "brain" activity
